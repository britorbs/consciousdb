# ConsciousDB – Your Vector Database *Is* the Model (formerly "consciousdb-sidecar")

> ⚠️ **v3 SDK‑First Migration:** The legacy sidecar HTTP pattern is now optional. The canonical integration path is the in‑process SDK (no server). The package name is `consciousdb` (old `consciousdb-sidecar` deprecated). The high‑level stable entrypoint is `solve_query` (surfaced via `ConsciousClient.query`). Server extras remain for transitional deployments.

> Stop stacking opaque rerankers. ConsciousDB turns the structure already latent in your vectors into an **explainable retrieval intelligence layer** – no training, no drift, full receipts.

> Elevator (non‑technical): **ConsciousDB makes vector search explainable. See exactly *why* results rank—without adding another AI model.**

## 📦 Install
Renamed package: publish / install as `consciousdb` (the previous `consciousdb-sidecar` name is deprecated).

SDK‑only (lean: numpy, scipy, pydantic):
```bash
pip install consciousdb
```
With optional legacy HTTP server + metrics layer:
```bash
pip install "consciousdb[server]"
```
Add connectors / embedders as needed, e.g.:
```bash
pip install "consciousdb[server,connectors-pgvector,embedders-sentence]"
```
Why slim? The default install should not pull a web server if you just want an in‑process ranking + receipt layer.

## �🚩 The Problem
Vector search gives you similarity – but not *understanding*. Teams struggle to answer:
- *Why* did these items outrank others?
- *How* do the results relate to each other (support / redundancy / gaps)?
- *What* specific structure change would improve relevance?

Typical fixes add another neural reranker (more latency, drift, & opacity) or a heavy offline graph build. Both increase operational surface and hide reasoning.

## 🎯 Core Idea (Database-as-Model)
Instead of inserting a new model, each query induces a tiny, ephemeral k‑NN graph over the recalled candidates. A fast **structure‑aware energy solve** (symmetric positive definite system) refines embeddings and produces a conserved ΔH (energy uplift) that naturally decomposes per item. That decomposition *is* the ranking explanation.

| You Want | Traditional Path | ConsciousDB Path |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Better ordering | Add / fine‑tune model | Solve energy on existing vectors |
| Explanation | Post‑hoc approximations | Built‑in per‑item ΔH terms |
| Low ops overhead | Maintain model infra | Lightweight CPU solve layer |
| Stability | Weight drift & retrains | No learned weights, fresh graph per query |
| Auditability | Sparse logs | Structured receipt JSON |

## 💎 What You Get
**Energy Receipt** – `deltaH_total` plus per-item components (coherence contribution, anchor / ground terms, neighbors, timings, fallback reasons).  
**Model‑Free Uplift** – Improved ordering using only your existing vectors.  
**Transparent Math** – Reproducible linear algebra; no hidden gradient soup.  
**Low Latency** – Typical local/mock ~50 ms P95 for k≤8 (CPU).  
**Bring Your Own Vector DB** – Pinecone, pgvector, Chroma, Vertex AI, in‑memory.

## 📊 Results In Practice *(early internal / synthetic reference)*
| Metric | Improvement / Figure | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| nDCG uplift | **~21%** vs raw cosine | Synthetic eval harness (see `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`) |
| P95 latency | **~50 ms** | Local/mock k≤8, CPU only |
| Follow-up LLM calls | **~35% fewer** | Higher initial relevance reduces clarifying turns |

*(Real public benchmark numbers will be published as dataset loaders land.)*

## 🤔 Why Not Just...
| Option | Hidden Cost | Still Lacks |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Add a neural reranker | Extra model infra, finetuning, drift | Native explanation, per-item energy traces |
| Build a knowledge graph | Heavy ETL, schema churn, stale edges | On-demand freshness, low ops footprint |
| Tune / re-embed corpus | Labeling effort, loss of generality | Live structural attribution, audit trail |

**ConsciousDB:** Light, explainable, works with what you already have.

## ✨ Quickstart (Pure SDK – Recommended)
```python
from consciousdb import ConsciousClient

client = ConsciousClient()  # uses default in‑memory mock unless env connectors set
result = client.query("vector governance controls", k=6, m=200)
print(result.deltaH_total, result.items[0].id)
```
Override connectors / embedders with environment variables or by passing instances to `ConsciousClient(...)` (see Connectors section below). The call internally performs:
1. Embed query
2. Recall M candidates from your vector DB (or mock)
3. Build ephemeral mutual kNN graph
4. Run SPD energy solve (CG)
5. Decompose ΔH into per-item parts
6. Rank (optionally diversify) and return a structured receipt

Return object fields (stable): `items`, `deltaH_total`, `diagnostics` (timings, cg_iters, redundancy, fallback, parameters).

For lower-level experimentation you can import `from engine.solve import solve_query` directly.

## ✨ Quickstart (Local Mock via Server Extra)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. ./.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1   # PowerShell
pip install "consciousdb[server]"
$env:USE_MOCK='true'
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8080 --reload
```
Query:
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"vector governance controls","k":6,"m":400}' | jq '.items[0],.diagnostics.deltaH_total'
```
Full schema: see `docs/API.md` & `docs/RECEIPTS.md`.

## ⚡ See It Work (60 Seconds) – Server Path
Requires Docker + docker compose plugin.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maverick0351a/consciousdb
cd consciousdb
docker compose up -d       # launches API + (optionally) demo if compose file present
sleep 3
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/query -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"vector governance controls","k":6,"m":300}' | jq '.diagnostics.deltaH_total'
```
Optional (if demo container configured): open http://localhost:8501

## 🧪 High-Level Flow (Conceptual)
```
Query → Vectors → Local Graph → Physics Solve → Explained Rankings (Receipt)
```
Minimal mental model:
1. Pull candidates (M) from your existing vector DB.
2. Construct ephemeral similarity graph (only these M nodes).
3. Run a fast energy minimization (convergence in a handful of iterations).
4. Decompose total uplift (ΔH) into per-item parts.
5. Rank + return receipt.

- Solve: Jacobi‑preconditioned CG over normalized Laplacian + anchor/ground diagonals.
- Attribution: Per-node split (coherence/anchor/ground) sums exactly to `deltaH_total`.
- Ranking blend: z‑scored coherence uplift + structure‑smoothed alignment (optional MMR when redundancy > threshold).

## 🧭 Migrating from Sidecar to SDK
| Before (Sidecar) | After (SDK) | Notes |
|------------------|------------|-------|
| POST /query JSON | `client.query(q, k, m)` | Same schema, now direct object return |
| Env: USE_MOCK | Auto in-memory mock | Provide real connector envs to switch |
| curl + jq | Python call | Lower latency, fewer hops |
| Custom reranker service | Built-in energy solve | ΔH receipt is explanation |
| Server scaling | In-process function | Scale with your app threads |

Deprecation timeline: the HTTP server extra will remain until at least v3.x LTS; receipt field backward compatibility maintained (additive only).

## 🛠 Contributing
Small, tested PRs welcome. Preserve backward compatibility of receipt fields; add new diagnostics additively. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## 🧪 Examples
Quickstart script: `examples/quickstart_sdk.py`

Run (PowerShell):
```powershell
python examples/quickstart_sdk.py
```
Outputs top results and `deltaH_total` plus demonstrates both `ConsciousClient` and direct `solve_query` usage.

## 🧪 Testing & Coverage Strategy
The test suite uses a dual-mode approach to balance speed and authentic solver coverage:

- Default: a lightweight stub of `solve_query` (activated via an autouse fixture) speeds up most tests.
- Opt-in real solver: mark tests with `@pytest.mark.real_solver` (or set env `REAL_SOLVER=1`) to exercise the full CG solve, energy decomposition, ranking, and MMR logic.

Why: The energy solve touches numerical branches (gating, fallback, redundancy, mmr) that would otherwise show as uncovered. By only enabling it where needed we keep total runtime low while keeping coverage >85% on core engine modules.

Key real-solver tests:
- `tests/test_real_solver_path.py` – full end-to-end receipt & energy path.
- `tests/test_rank_energy_mm.py` – MMR path, redundancy computation.
- `tests/test_solver_branches.py` – baseline early gate and forced fallback branches.

To run the full suite with authentic solver paths:
```powershell
$env:REAL_SOLVER='1'; pytest -q --cov=engine
```
(Or selectively remove the stub fixture in `tests/conftest.py`).
